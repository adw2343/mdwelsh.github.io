I am a Principal Engineer and head of the Platform and Systems
teams at [Xnor.ai](https://www.xnor.ai/).
We develop AI technology that runs efficiently on embedded devices.

Prior to joining Xnor, I was a Principal Engineer at Google from
2010 until 2019, where I led the Chrome Mobile team at Google's Seattle 
and Kirkland offices. Our team focused on making the web great for
the next billion Internet users in emerging markets. Some of our
team's projects included:

* [Chrome Data Saver](/papers/flywheel-nsdi15.pdf), allowing Chrome to save more than 60% of mobile data
* Network optimizations for [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) and [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic)
* New techniques for optimizing web content using cloud rendering
* Support for saving, reading, and preloading [offline pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)
* Web platform API support for mobile adaptations - [Netinfo ECT](https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/#effective-connection-types), [Save-Data hints](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/save-data)
* Developing new browser capabilities to help users discover new web content and more effectively multitask on small screens

Prior to joining Google, I was a professor of Computer Science at
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) from
2003 until 2010, and a senior researcher at
[Intel Research](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/intel-research.html), Berkeley
from 2002-2003. I did my PhD in Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/) (2002)
and my bachelor's in Computer Science at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) (1996).

My research interests span a broad range of topics in the space of mobile computing,
operating systems, networks, distributed systems, and programming languages.

I also do a bunch of software and electronics projects under the banner of [Team Sidney Enterprises](https://teamsidney.com).
