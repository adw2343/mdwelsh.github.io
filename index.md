I am an engineering lead and computer scientist at [Apple](https://www.apple.com), working on
the Machine Intelligence team in Seattle. My team specializes in optimized on-device AI.

Prior to Apple, I was a Principal Engineer at [Xnor.ai](https://www.xnor.ai), a Seattle-based startup developing
efficient AI for embedded systems. I led Xnor's Platform and Systems team, focusing on our high-performance
inference engine. Xnor joined Apple in early 2020.

Prior to Xnor, I spent 8 years at Google as a Principal Engineer and lead for the Chrome Mobile
team in Seattle. Our team focused on making Chrome and the web great for the next billion users, developing new
browser capabilities to make the web faster and use less data.

Some of our team's projects included:

* [Chrome Data Saver](/papers/flywheel-nsdi15.pdf), allowing Chrome to save more than 60% of mobile data
* Network optimizations for [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) and [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic)
* New techniques for optimizing web content using cloud rendering
* Support for saving, reading, and preloading [offline pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)
* Web platform API support for mobile adaptations - [Netinfo ECT](https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/#effective-connection-types), [Save-Data hints](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/save-data)
* Developing new browser capabilities to help users discover new web content and more effectively multitask on small screens

Prior to joining Google, I was a professor of Computer Science at
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) from
2003 until 2010, and a senior researcher at
[Intel Research](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/intel-research.html), Berkeley
from 2002-2003. I did my PhD in Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/) (2002)
and my bachelor's in Computer Science at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) (1996).

My research interests span a broad range of topics in the space of mobile computing,
operating systems, networks, distributed systems, and programming languages.

I also do a bunch of software and electronics projects under the banner of [Team Sidney Enterprises](https://teamsidney.com).
